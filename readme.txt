DESCRIPTION
===========
   This example project shows how to use the IAR Embedded Workbench for ARM
  to develop code for the IAR-STM32-SK evaluation board. It shows
  basic use of the I/O,the timer and the interrupt controller.
   Displays running lights on the board's LEDs.

COMPATIBILITY
=============
   The GettingStarted example project is compatible with IAR-STM32-SK
  evaluation board. By default, the project is configured to use the
  J-Link JTAG/SWD interface.

CONFIGURATION
=============
   The GettingStarted application is downloaded to the Embedded RAM or
  Embedded Flash memory depending of configurations on the evaluation
  board and executed.
   Make sure that the following jumpers are correctly configured on the
  IAR STM32-SK evaluation board:

   Jumpers:
  PWR_SEL - depending of power source

GETTING STARTED
===============
  1) Build and download the example.

  2) Run the example.
